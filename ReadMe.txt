To run the hand tracker and output the results to the Arduino:
1. $cd ~/Documents/OAK/depthai
2. $source myvenv/bin/activate
3. $cd ~/Documents/OAK/depthai_hand_tracker
4. $python3 system_run.py

Make sure the Arduino script 'arduino_serial_hand_tracker.ino' is currently loaded on the microcontroller and the serial cable is connected between the Raspi and Arduino.
